# Trusted Committers

**Trusted Committers** (TC's) are members of our community who we have explicitly added to our GitHub repository. Trusted Committers have elevated rights, allowing them to send in changes directly to branches and to approve Pull Requests. (GitHub refers to these accounts as [collaborators][collaborators]).

We ask that TC's open Pull-Request when making changes, to make these changes transparent for everybody.

## What you get as a Trusted Committer:

- **WRITE** access to this repository (no need to maintain your own fork)
- More immediate impact on the roadmap and feature development of GenRMQ
- Fame and glory in the GenRMQ community :)

## What we expect from a Trusted Committer:

- Help us to drive the conversations in GitHub Issues (e.g. provide feedback to other user of GenRMQ or answer their questions)
- Review pull requests (e.g. by helping the author of the PR understand what needs to be done in order to get the PR into a mergeable shape)
- Be a role model for our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Adding Trusted Committers 

It is our ambition to empower as many trusted Trusted Committers as possible.

When a GitHub user has made a couple of contributions to GenRMQ, we will contact them and ask them if they want to support the development of GenRMQ by becoming a Trusted Committer. We will use a GitHub issue on this repo to do that.
