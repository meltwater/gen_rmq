# Contributing to GenRMQ

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to GenRMQ. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

As we are a fairly small community so far, we will keep these guidelines very lightweight for now.

## How to Contribute

We happily accept contributions as [GitHub PRs][github_prs] or bug reports, comments/suggestions or usage questions by creating a [GitHub issue][gen_rmq_issues].

## Code of Conduct

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Therefore we follow the [Contributor Covenant v2.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).

## Inspiration for these Guidelines

We took some inspiration from [Writing your contributing guidelines](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/#writing-your-contributing-guidelines) and [Contributing to Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
