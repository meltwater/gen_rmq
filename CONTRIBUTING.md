# Contributing to GenRMQ

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to GenRMQ. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

As we are a fairly small community so far, we will keep these guidelines very lightweight for now.

## How to Contribute

We happily accept contributions as [GitHub PRs][github_prs] or bug reports, comments/suggestions or usage questions by creating a [GitHub issue][gen_rmq_issues].

## Inspiration for these Guidelines

We took some inspiration from [Writing your contributing guidelines](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/#writing-your-contributing-guidelines) and [Contributing to Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
