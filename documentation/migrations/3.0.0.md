Migrating to version 3.*
========================

Since version `3.0.0` we have introduced couple of non-backwards compatible changes. This guide is
supposed to help you migrate to it if you have been using previous versions (< `3.0.0`).

# Migration steps

## Upgrade Elixir and OTP

* Ensure you are using at least `Elixir 1.8`
* Ensure you are using at least `OTP 21.0`

## Adjust consumed Telemetry events

If you have been using `Telemetry` events dispatched by `GenRMQ`, introduced in version `2.4.0`, here is the list of changes:

* Event `[:gen_rmq, :consumer, :message, :error]` replaced by `[:gen_rmq, :consumer, :message, :exception]`
* Event `[:gen_rmq, :publisher, :message, :error]` removed. Event `[:gen_rmq, :publisher, :message, :stop]` dispatched instead with `metadata` containing error details
* Measurment `time` containing monothonic time, replaced by `system_time` containing system time. Check [System][system] documentation for more details regarding differences

Feel free to visit detailed `Telemetry` events documentation for [publisher][publisher_telemetry_events]
and [consumer][consumer_telemetry_events] behaviours. If have not started to use them, no required migration steps.
